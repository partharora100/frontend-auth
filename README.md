## Why this project

In this project I learnt about how to work with react forms and basic props drilling.

Later I tries to migrate from prop drilling to contextAPI that react offers to understand the use case of it better.

### Topics covered in this section!

1. useEffect and side-effects.
2. useEffect cleanup.
3. React Context API.
4. Refactoring the Input Component.
